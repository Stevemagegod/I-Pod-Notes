Captain Tenzin Yamato Training
Battle Field Simulation 
A Ninja must stick to his Mission until the bitter end. 

Technically there is no such thing as a Wood Nature. By activating the Earth and Water Nature simultaneously he's able to create something new a Wood Nature. Earth with my Right Hand Water with my Left. When one possesses two Chakra Natures it's not that difficult to use each of them independently. But to be able to activate and use both of them simultaneously. This ability to activate two Chakra Natures at the same time, in order to create a new Nature is known as Kekkei Genkai. 

Even in Death the body of a Ninja contains a Wealth of Information. 

You should never over estimate the power of your own Jutsu. Always make sure that the job is done.
