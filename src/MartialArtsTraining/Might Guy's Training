Primary Lotus
The Primary Lotus is now Forbidden. This Jutsu puts a Huge Strain on your body's Muscles. It's a self Sacrificing Technique. Normal Humans only use at most 20% of their Muscles Strength. If all of the power were to be used the Muscles would Dissengrate so the Brain regulates the amount of power the Muscles can exgerate. But this Jutsu is different it uses Chakra which forces the Brain to go past it's limits allowing for continuous high speed Taijutsu. In other words this Jutsu relies on a secret technique that brings forth power almost to the limits of the Human Body. The Primary Lotus opens only the first gate the Gate of Opening.

Hidden Lotus 
This technique is even more forbidden than the Primary Lotus. It is not without danger but it will be your Trump Card. But listen you can only use this Forbidden technique on one occasion. One very strict condition and that is to Protect and Maintain ones own Ninja Way.
