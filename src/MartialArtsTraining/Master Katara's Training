Master Katara's Training
Water tribe warrior preparations include: gloves, boots, face paint, warm up jumping jacks [Which Sokka isn't doing]...will do later.

Advanced Waterbenders can create waves of just about any size.

The "Water Whip" is the Water Tribe's most effective combat move.

In our tribe, it is forbidden for women to learn waterbending.
Waterbending can Heal by using their Power to open a Body's Chi Path.
You're moving the Water around but you're not feeling the Push and Pull.
This move is all about Sinking and Floating.
