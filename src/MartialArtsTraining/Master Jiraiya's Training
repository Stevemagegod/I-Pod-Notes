Rasengan (3 Weeks)
With the Tree Climbing Exercise you learned to gather and maintain Chakra. With Water Walking exercise you learn to release a steady amount of it. With the Water Balloon Exercise you will learn to create a stream of Chakra spinning it.
First Gather the Chakra in your hand using the Tree Climbing Technique. Then release a steady stream of it using the Walk on Water Technique and finally use the Chakra to push and turn the Water inside of the Balloon. A good way to build up Chakra in the body is to spin it in a tight spiral. Whether the Chakra spins to the left or the Right depends on the individual. 

Stage 2 Rasengan 
The first element is Rotation. The second element is Force. But this object is solid there is no Water inside so it is far more difficult to exert your Chakra Rotation on it. 

Stage 3 Rasengan 
The first step you learned was Rotation. The Second step was power. The third step you gotta draw up 100% of what you learned so far and then maintain it. In other words keeping the power and the rotation of your Chakra at their Maximum. First visualize the thin membrane just inside the balloon. Then of compressing the Chakra inside it.
