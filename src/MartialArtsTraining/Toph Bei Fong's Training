Toph Bei Fong's Training
You've gotta open your brain to the possibilities.
There are options in fighting called Jing. It's a choice on how you direct your Energy. There's positive Jing when you're attacking and Negative Jing when you're Retreating. And Neutral Jing: When you do Nothing. Neutral Jing is the Key to Earthbending. It involves Listening and Waiting for the Right Moment to Strike. 

Earthbending is based on a style of Kung Fu called Hung Gar. Hung Gar Kung Fu uses strong stances, rooting the fighter to the ground.

Earthbending involves striking the ground with the hands or feet.

Let's Start with Move A Rock.

You've got to Stop thinking like an Airbender. There's no "different angle", no clever solution,no trickety trick that's gonna move that rock! You've got to face it head on.

You Shouldn't give 100% of your Energy into any one Strike. You've gotta be quick and accurate. Hit a Series of points and break your opponent's Stance. And when he's reeling back you deliver the Final blow. His own Weight becomes his downfall.

All Metal has small amounts of Earth in it.

I can move Boulders with just my Eyebrow
I can only "see" things that are made of Earth, or Touching the Ground.
I can see the same whether it's in the light or the dark.
